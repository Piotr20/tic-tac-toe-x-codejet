This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Build

# and
npm run start
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run test

## Project Description

Project Description
This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications. The game allows two players to compete against each other in a classic 3x3 grid format. The project demonstrates the use of modern web development practices, including:

### Stack

- React: For building the user interface components.
- Next.js: For server-side rendering and static site generation.
- TypeScript: For type safety and improved developer experience.
- XState: For state management.
- Jest: For unit testing the application components.
- Testing Library: For testing React components in a user-centric way.

### Features

- Real-time Gameplay: The game updates in real-time as players make their moves.
- Custom player names.
- Custom Size Boards: Allow players to choose the size of the game board, such as 4x4 or 5x5, providing a more challenging gameplay experience.
- Small sample tests written in Jest.

I encourage to see this project for more comprehensive show of my skills
[Bachelor project](https://github.com/Piotr20/Bachelor-project) there I used styled components, framer-motion, zustand etc. as well as
paid more attention to the code quality.
